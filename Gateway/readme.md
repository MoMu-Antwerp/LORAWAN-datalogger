## Step 1: #Hardware - Ordering Parts
<img src="documentation/1_1.png" height="250" />

See the shopping list an up-to-date overview:
- [Shopping list for the project.](/Shopping_list.md)

In the construction of the gateway you have a few options in the features you like to add:
- Either an active or passive gateway (with or without sensors on the gateway).
- Lora gateway or just an active sensor (with or without lorawan concentrator shield).
- With or without camera module for bug tracking or other camera applications.

> In the instructions below we describe the most commong optional parts (without camera and without sensors). 
> But note that you can easily leave out the lorawan concentrator as well if you already have gateways on site.

***Be carefull*** about the screws nearby the Raspberry Pi. Don't overtighten the screws and if you notice it being to close to the electronics we advice you to shim the parts a bit or to use a smaller screw.

1. You should see the status update to "connected" within a few minutes on TTN.

## Step 19: #Software - Setup Gateway - Sensor / Camera - Install (optional)
<img src="documentation/19_1.png" height="150" /> <img src="documentation/19_2.png" height="150" /> <img src="documentation/19_3.png" height="150" /> <img src="documentation/19_4.png" height="150" /> <img src="documentation/19_5.png" height="150" /> <img src="documentation/19_6.png" height="150" />

### Instructions:

1. Check if you have python 3 on your Raspberry Pi. In the terminal type => python3
1. If you don't have python 3, follow this install instructions:
1. type => `sudo apt update`
1. type => `sudo apt upgrade`
1. type => `sudo apt install python3 idle3`
1. Now you should have python 3. Please check again with the 1. first step.
1. Activate camera / I2C / SPI: _(you might have done this already in the LoRa setup)_
1. In the terminal type => `sudo raspi-config`
    - Go to Interfacing Options.
        - Enable camera
        - Enable I2C
        - Enable SPI
1. Install following libraries: (type these commands in the terminal)
    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev

    pip3 install numpy
    pip3 install opencv-python
    pip3 install scikit-image
    pip3 install schedule
    pip3 install getmac

<img src="documentation/20_1.png" height="150" /> <img src="documentation/20_2.png" height="150" /> <img src="documentation/20_3.png" height="150" />

### Focus setup:
1. Before running the final code we have to focus our camera unit. 
1. In a command line window type:
    ```
    from picamera import PiCamera
    from time import sleep

    camera = PiCamera()

    camera.start_preview()
    sleep(20)
    camera.stop_preview()
    ```
1. This provides you a live preview of the camera. 
1. Focus the camera by rotating it's lens.
1. After 20sec the preview stops, but you can re-run the code as much as needed.

### Instructions:

1. Download the python script `mumo.py` from github: [Gateway python code](Gateway/Python/mumo.py)
1. Place the code on your desktop.
1. Open a terminal and type > `sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart`
1. Copy this line on to the bottom off the file > `@lxterminal -e python3 /home/pi/Desktop/mumo.py`
1. Save the file and close it.
1. Now the script will automatically start at restart.
1. Open the code.
1. ***Change to your URL endpoint.*** 
    - This is where to send the data on your backend server.
    - This data goes straight to the dashboard and not trough TTN.

### Instructions:

1. Place the Trap_Frame part on top of the camera housing. The trap has some space for the power usb cable of the gateway, therefore check the pictures for the correct orientation.
1. Fixate with two M3 screws on the left and right side of the camera housing.
1. Insert your (60 x 75) mm bug paper into the slot of the trap. There are two slots, in the front and back direction. It depends how you will position the gateway.
1. The power usb cable can be weaved between the open structure of the trap part.

## Step 24: #Hardware - Mounting the Gateway
### The gateway is provided with many options to mount the gateway.
<img src="documentation/24_1.jpg" height="250" /> <img src="documentation/24_2.jpg" height="250" /> <img src="documentation/24_3.jpg" height="250" /> <img src="documentation/24_4.jpg" height="250" /> <img src="documentation/24_5.jpg" height="250" /> <img src="documentation/24_6.jpg" height="250" /> <img src="documentation/24_7.jpg" height="250" />

We have two screw slots on which the gateway can be hung.

And also have cable ties grooves, so you can easily attach the gateway to anything.


## Step 25: #Hardware - Differed Orientations
The gateway is modular so that the sensors and camera can be mounted in different orientations. You can also create your own components and add them to the setup.
