# MuMo
The MuMo project is an attempt to make an open source easy to setup platform to monitor environmental conditions of multiple sensors using IOT Lora modules and off the shelf hardware. 

MuMo stands for Museum Monitoring since the initial founder of the project is the fashion museum in Antwerp (named MoMu) and developed in collaboration with the University of Antwerp - Department of Product Development.  

The project consists of 3 main parts. A sensor node design, a gateway that also houses various sensors and a dashboard that visualizes all recorded measurements and can alert users of any out of bounds values. 

### The sensor node 

The sensor node is built around a Lorawan Seeed board that contains a ATSAMD21 processor (arduino zero compatible) and a RHF76 Lora module. 

It features Seeed grove sensor connectors that can accommodate a series of sensor. In this project we chose a BME680 that records environment temperature, relative humidity and barometric pressure and a TSL2561 to measure visible lux values. 

To power the unit for a long period of time we house 6 AA batteries that should last around two years (depending on the frequency of measurements sent). 

All in a 3D printer optimized housing and programmable without special tools. 

The code features: 

The Things Network connection 

Measurement frequency from minutes to days 

Intermittent measurements every minute to check for extreme conditions. 

Immediate warning transmissions if any warnings are raised. 

Down-linkable updates to all settings 

Ability to connect other sensors by adding their library and implementation. 

Decent power efficiency by using the internal RTC of the ATSAMD21 (down to 65 ÂµA) 

### The Gateway 

Build around a Raspberry Pi and containing a Dragino lora concentrator, dust particle sensor, Grove sensor shield with environmental sensors connected and a bug detection camera. Most of these components are modular and optional, so that any useful combination of elements can be made. 

The inclusion of the Dragino Lora concentrator makes this unit a Lora gateway that receives all data from the nodes and forwards the data to the things network through a WIFI connection or Ethernet. Using this board hundreds of nodes can be connected. 

Python code on the Pi records all measurements like is done on the Nodes themselves. But in this case also utilizes the power consuming VOC measurements of the BME680 and an extra dust particle sensor (also power consuming that would not be desirable in the battery powered nodes). 

A night vision camera can be placed in various locations around the unit to record bug traps. It provides a daily updated picture that can give a history log of events that occurred.  

This unit also features a 3D printer optimized housing and is programmable without specialist tools. 

### The Dashboard 

The dashboard makes the data received by the things network from all gateways and nodes visual by showing the latest measurements of all sensors. And shows graph of all recorded measurements up to date. It gives a manageable overview to setup alerts for any out of bound recordings and can be integrated in other platforms as desired. 

Requirements: 

PHP version 5.6 or greater. 

MYSQL version 5.6 or greater or MariaDB version 10.1 or greater. 

Online accessible url (may be a subdomain as well)
